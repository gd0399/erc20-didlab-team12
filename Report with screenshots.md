# ERC20 DIDLab Project – Team 12

This report documents the deployment and interaction with the ERC20 token **CampusCredit (CAMP)** on the DIDLab Team 12 private blockchain.  
All required experiments from contract compilation to MetaMask configuration are included.

---

## A. Compile Contracts

The ERC20 smart contract was compiled successfully using **Hardhat**.  
We used Solidity version `0.8.28`.

*Fig 2: Confirmation that Solidity contracts compiled without error.*

---

## B. Faucet Accounts

Hardhat provides local accounts pre-funded with **10,000 ETH** each.  
We used these accounts for deployment and testing.

## C. Deploy Contract

We deployed the **CampusCredit** ERC20 contract.  
The deployment produced a contract address which was added to `.env`.

- **Deployed Contract:** `0x850ec3780cedfdb116e38b009d0bf7a1ef1b8b38`  
- **Token Name:** CampusCredit  
- **Symbol:** CAMP

## D. Interactions

### D.1 — Transfer & Approve
We tested **ERC20 transfer** and **approve** functionality.  
- 100 CAMP was transferred between accounts.  
- An allowance of 50 CAMP was approved.

*Fig 5: Transfer and approval transactions confirmed with balances and allowances.*

---

### D.2 — Batch vs Single Transfers
We compared **gas consumption** between multiple single transfers and a batch transfer.

- **Single Transfers:** 67,226 gas  
- **Batch Transfer:** 51,216 gas  
- **Gas Saved:** ~23.82%

![Batch vs Single](./batch_vs_single.png)  
*Fig 6: Batch transfers reduce gas cost significantly.*

---

### D.3 — Logs & Events
We queried **Transfer** and **Approval** events over recent blocks.  
Both types of events were correctly emitted by the contract.

### D.4 — Transaction Gas Details
Detailed gas usage was inspected for transfer and airdrop calls.

## E. MetaMask Configuration

### E.1 — Add DIDLab Network
MetaMask was configured with our custom network:  

- **Network Name:** DIDLab Team 12  
- **RPC URL:** `http://hh-12.didlabs.org`  
- **Chain ID:** 31348  
- **Currency Symbol:** ETH

### E.2 — Network Connection
After configuration, MetaMask connected successfully to **DIDLab Team 12** and displayed the faucet balance.
